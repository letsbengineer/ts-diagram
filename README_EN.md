### Section 1: Basic Usage - Adding Points

The first step in creating a diagram is adding state points. Multiple methods are available.

#### Method A: Individual Point Addition (Calculated)

This is the most powerful method. It adds a point by calculating all properties from two known thermodynamic properties.

1. In the **left panel**, open the `‚ûï Add Points & Data` section.
2. Click on the `Single Point` tab.
3. Ensure `Calculate (XSteam)` mode is selected.
4. In the **Point Name** field, enter a name for your point (e.g., `1`, `Boiler Inlet`).
5. From the **Known Property 1** and **Known Property 2** menus, select the two properties you know (e.g., `Pressure (P)` and `Quality (x)`).
6. Enter the values for these properties in the boxes below.
    * **Tip:** You can also use special text like `hf` (saturated liquid enthalpy), `hg` (saturated vapor enthalpy), or `Tsat` (saturation temperature).
7. Click the `üßÆ Calculate & Add Point` button. Your point will be calculated and added to the diagram.

#### Method B: Individual Point Addition (Manual T-s)

If you already know a point's T and s values and don't want to perform calculations:

1. While in the `Single Point` tab, switch to `Direct (T, s)` mode.
2. Enter the **Point Name**, **Temperature (¬∞C)**, and **Entropy (kJ/kg¬∑K)** values.
3. Click the `üìç Add T-s Point` button.

#### Method C: Bulk Data Entry (P-h or T-s)

If you have data for multiple points in tabular form, you can enter them all at once.

1. Click on the `Bulk Import / Update` tab.
2. **For Points (T,s):**
    * Paste your data into the first text area in `Name Temperature Entropy` format, with one point per line. Values can be separated by spaces or tabs.
    * Click the `Apply T-s Data` button.
3. **For XSteam (P,h):**
    * Enter your data in the second text area in `Name Pressure(kPa) Enthalpy(kJ/kg)` format. You can also use `hf` or `hg` as enthalpy values.
    * Click the `Apply P-h Data` button. The system will calculate and add all points.
    * The `Load Current` button loads the P-h values of existing points into this area.

### Section 2: Defining Processes - Connections

After adding points, you can create connections to show the processes (cycle steps) between them.

#### Manual Connection Creation

1. Click the `üîó Connect` button in the control bar above the canvas. The button will turn red and your cursor will change.
2. Click on the starting point.
3. Drag your mouse toward the ending point; a dashed line will appear.
4. Click on the ending point. A connection (line) will be created between them.
5. To exit connection mode, click the `üîó Cancel` button or press the `ESC` key.

#### Connection Settings Panel

To customize a connection you've created, use the **right panel**.

1. Open the `üîó Connection Settings` section.
2. From the **Source Point** and **Target Point** menus, select the start and end points of the connection you want to edit.
3. The panel settings will automatically populate with that connection's properties:
    * **Line Style:** Choose `Solid`, `Dashed`, or `Dotted`.
    * **Label (on-line):** Label that appears on the line (e.g., `Heat Input`, `Work Output`).
    * **Legend Label:** Label that appears in the legend box.
    * **Color Box and Width:** Adjust the line's color and thickness.
    * **Show in Legend:** Choose whether this connection appears in the legend.
4. Click the `üîÑ Update Connection` button to apply changes.

#### Bulk Connection Editor (Expert User)

This is the most efficient way to quickly create complex structures like Rankine cycles.

1. In the **left panel**, open the `üîó Bulk Connection Editor` section.
2. Write your commands in a special format in the text area. Click the `‚ìò` icon to open the help menu for detailed information.
3. **Basic Formats:**
    * **Connection:** `SourcePoint,TargetPoint,"Label",Color,Style`
    * **Point Creation:** `PointName(p=1000,x=0)`
    * **All-in-One:** `1(p=10,x=0), 2(p=5000,s=*1), "Pump Work"`
        * This command creates point 1, calculates point 2 isentropically referencing point 1's entropy, and draws a line labeled "Pump Work" between them.
4. Click the `‚Ü• Apply Changes` button to execute all commands.

### Section 3: Canvas Interaction

#### Managing Points

* **Selecting:** Click on a point to make it active and view its details in the right properties panel.
* **Moving (Dragging):** Click and hold a selected point, then drag to change its position. This changes the point's *visual* T and s values but doesn't affect its calculated thermodynamic properties.
* **Deleting:** After selecting a point, click the small `üóëÔ∏è` icon that appears on it or press the `Delete` key.
* **Right-Click Menu:** Right-clicking on a point opens a menu offering edit, delete, and connection initiation options.

#### Panning and Zooming

* **Panning:** Click and hold on an empty area of the canvas and drag to navigate the diagram.
* **Zooming:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out at your cursor's location. These features can be disabled with the `Allow Dragging` and `Allow Zoom` options in the top control bar.

#### Bending Lines (Curved Processes)

Real-world processes aren't always straight lines.

1. Ensure the `Allow Bending` option in the top control bar is active.
2. When you hover your mouse over the middle of a line, a small control point will appear.
3. Click and hold this control point and drag to curve the line.
4. To straighten the line again, use the `Reset Curve` button in the `Connection Settings` section of the right panel.

#### Presentation Mode

Clicking the `Presentation` button simplifies parts of the interface, automatically displays point labels, and prepares the diagram for a cleaner presentation. Click again to return to editing mode.

### Section 4: Advanced Tools and Analysis

#### Plotting Iso-lines (Isobars)

To plot constant pressure curves (isobars) on the diagram:

1. In the **left panel**, open the `„Ä∞Ô∏è Plot Iso-Lines` section.
2. Enter the pressure value you want to plot in the **Pressure (kPa)** field.
3. Click the `Plot Isobar` button.
4. The `Plot All Point Pressures` button automatically plots isobars for all your existing points' pressure values.

#### Custom Cycle Efficiency Calculation

You can calculate the thermal efficiency of any cycle you've defined.

1. In the **left panel**, open the `üìä Custom Cycle Efficiency` section. (This section becomes active after at least 3 points are added).
2. Under **Heat Input (Q_H) Processes**, define processes where heat enters the cycle. For example, for the boiler process, click `+ Add Boiler/Heater`, then select the inlet and outlet points.
3. Under **Heat Rejection (Q_L) Processes**, define processes where heat leaves the cycle (e.g., condenser).
4. For each process, enter the mass flow rate (`Mass Flow`) in kg/s.
5. Click the `üßÆ Calculate Efficiency` button. The result will be displayed below.
