### Part 1: Basic Usage - Adding Points

The first step in creating a diagram is to add your state points. There are several ways to do this.

#### Method A: Add a Single Point (Calculated)

This is the most powerful method. It calculates all other properties from two known ones using the XSteam library.

1.  In the **left panel**, expand the `➕ Add Points & Data` section.
2.  Click the `Single Point` tab.
3.  Ensure the `Calculate (XSteam)` mode is active.
4.  In the **Point Name** field, give your point a name (e.g., `1`, `Turbine Inlet`).
5.  Select the two properties you know from the **Known Property 1** and **Known Property 2** dropdowns (e.g., `Pressure (P)` and `Quality (x)`).
6.  Enter the corresponding values in the input boxes below.
    *   **Pro Tip:** You can also use special string values like `hf` (saturated liquid enthalpy), `hg` (saturated vapor enthalpy), or `Tsat` (saturation temperature).
7.  Click the `🧮 Calculate & Add Point` button. Your point will be calculated and added to the diagram.

#### Method B: Add a Single Point (Direct T-s)

If you already know the T and s values for a point and don't need calculations:

1.  In the `Single Point` tab, switch to the `Direct (T, s)` mode.
2.  Enter the **Point Name**, **Temperature (°C)**, and **Entropy (kJ/kg·K)**.
3.  Click the `📍 Add T-s Point` button.

#### Method C: Bulk Data Import (P-h or T-s)

If you have data for multiple points in a table, you can import them all at once.

1.  Click the `Bulk Import / Update` tab.
2.  **For T-s Data:**
    *   In the first text area, paste your data in the format `Name Temperature Entropy` for each line. Values can be separated by spaces or tabs.
    *   Click the `Apply T-s Data` button.
3.  **For P-h Data (with XSteam calculation):**
    *   In the second text area, paste your data in the format `Name Pressure(kPa) Enthalpy(kJ/kg)`. You can use `hf` or `hg` for the enthalpy value.
    *   Click the `Apply P-h Data` button. The system will calculate and add all points.
    *   The `Load Current` button will populate this text area with the P-h data of all points currently on your canvas.

### Part 2: Defining Processes - Connections

Once you have points, you can create connections between them to represent processes (steps in a cycle).

#### Creating Connections Manually

1.  Click the `🔗 Connect` button in the control bar above the canvas. The button will turn red, and your cursor will change.
2.  Click on the starting point of your process.
3.  Move your mouse toward the target point; a dashed line will follow.
4.  Click on the target point. A connection (line) will be created.
5.  To exit connect mode, click the `🔗 Cancel` button or press the `ESC` key.

#### Using the Connection Settings Panel

Use the **right panel** to customize any connection you've created.

1.  Expand the `🔗 Connection Settings` section.
2.  Select the **Source Point** and **Target Point** of the connection you want to edit from the dropdowns.
3.  The panel's settings will automatically load that connection's properties:
    *   **Line Style:** Choose `Solid`, `Dashed`, or `Dotted`.
    *   **Label (on-line):** A text label that appears on the line itself (e.g., `Heat Addition`, `Work Output`).
    *   **Legend Label:** A label that appears in the diagram's legend box.
    *   **Color Picker & Width:** Set the line's color and thickness.
    *   **Show in Legend:** Check this box to make the connection appear in the legend.
4.  Click the `🔄 Update Connection` button to apply your changes.

#### The Bulk Connection Editor (Advanced)

This is the fastest way to script complex cycles like the Rankine cycle.

1.  In the **left panel**, expand the `🔗 Bulk Connection Editor` section.
2.  Enter commands into the text area using a special syntax. Click the `ⓘ` help icon for a detailed guide.
3.  **Basic Formats:**
    *   **Connection:** `SourcePoint,TargetPoint,"Label",Color,Style`
    *   **Point Creation:** `PointName(p=1000,x=0)`
    *   **All-in-one:** `1(p=10,x=0), 2(p=5000,s=*1), "Pump Work"`
        *   This command creates point 1, calculates point 2 isentropically (using the entropy of point 1 as a reference), and draws a line between them labeled "Pump Work".
4.  Click the `↥ Apply Changes` button to execute all commands.

### Part 3: Interacting with the Canvas

#### Managing Points

*   **Select:** Click a point to make it active. Its properties will appear in the right-hand panel.
*   **Move (Drag):** Click, hold, and drag a selected point to change its position. This changes its *visual* T and s values but does not affect its calculated thermodynamic properties.
*   **Delete:** After selecting a point, click the small `🗑️` icon that appears above it, or press the `Delete` key on your keyboard.
*   **Right-Click Menu:** Right-clicking on a point opens a context menu with options to Edit, Delete, or Start a Connection.

#### Panning & Zooming the View

*   **Pan:** Click and drag on any empty area of the canvas to move the diagram around.
*   **Zoom:** Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out, centered on your cursor's position. These features can be disabled via the `Allow Dragging` and `Allow Zoom` checkboxes in the top control bar.

#### Bending Lines (Curved Processes)

Real-world processes are not always ideal straight lines.

1.  Ensure `Allow Bending` is checked in the top control bar.
2.  Hover your mouse over the middle of a line; a small control point will appear.
3.  Click and drag this control point to give the line a curve.
4.  To straighten the line again, use the `Reset Curve` button under `Connection Settings` in the right panel.

#### Presentation Mode

Clicking the `Presentation` button simplifies the UI, automatically shows all point labels, and prepares the diagram for a clean, focused view. Click it again to return to editing mode.

### Part 4: Advanced Tools & Analysis

#### Plotting Iso-Lines (Isobars)

To draw constant pressure lines (isobars) on your diagram:

1.  In the **left panel**, expand the `〰️ Plot Iso-Lines` section.
2.  Enter a pressure value in the **Pressure (kPa)** field.
3.  Click the `Plot Isobar` button.
4.  The `Plot All Point Pressures` button will automatically draw isobars for the pressure values of all points currently on the canvas.

#### Custom Cycle Efficiency Calculation

You can calculate the thermal efficiency of any cycle you define.

1.  In the **left panel**, expand the `📊 Custom Cycle Efficiency` section. (This is enabled once you have at least 3 points).
2.  Under **Heat Input (Q_H) Processes**, define the processes where heat is added to your cycle. Click `+ Add Boiler/Heater` and select the inlet and outlet points for that process.
3.  Under **Heat Rejection (Q_L) Processes**, define the processes where heat is removed from your cycle (e.g., the condenser).
4.  Enter the **Mass Flow** rate in kg/s for each process.
5.  Click the `🧮 Calculate Efficiency` button. The result will be displayed below.

### Part 5: Customizing the Appearance

#### Global View Settings

The checkboxes in the control bar above the canvas allow you to instantly toggle major visual elements:
*   `Saturation Curve`: Shows/hides the saturation dome.
*   `Show Lines`: Shows/hides the connections between points.
*   `Show Labels`: Shows/hides the names of the points.
*   `Show Arrows`: Shows/hides the direction arrows on the process lines.

#### Changing Point and Line Properties

The `🎨 Appearance Settings` section in the **right panel** gives you full control over visuals:
*   **Global:** Adjust the default thickness for all lines and the saturation curve.
*   **Point Specific:** Select a point from the dropdown and change its color, size, or label color individually.

#### The Legend and Notes Boxes

*   **Legend:** Located in the top-right of the canvas. It displays any connection that has the `Show in Legend` box checked in its settings. You can drag the legend box by its header to reposition it.
*   **Notes:** A draggable text box in the top-left where you can add custom notes about your project. These notes are saved with your project file.
